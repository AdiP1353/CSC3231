# Octagon – How to Play

## Overview

Octagon is a fast paced, reflex driven action defence game.  
You defend a central octagon using directional shields while deciding when to block harmful bombs and when to let beneficial apples hit the core to score points.

***

## How to Open

- Open Assets>Scenes>Menu.unity
- Unity Version: 6000.0.36f1 (LTS)

## Controls

- You stand at the centre of the screen and never move.
- There are eight shield segments around you:
    - North
    - North East
    - East
    - South East
    - South
    - South West
    - West
    - North West
- Each segment is mapped to a directional input (for example arrows or stick directions).
- Hold a direction to activate the shield in that segment.
- Release the direction to deactivate the shield immediately.

The key idea: **a shield only exists while you keep pressing the corresponding direction**.

## Core Rules

### Bombs

- Bombs are harmful projectiles.
- If a bomb hits the core, you lose health.
- If your health reaches zero, the game ends.
- If a bomb hits an active shield, it is repelled and you avoid damage.

Your goal with bombs: **block them with the correct shield segment**.

### Apples

- Apples are beneficial projectiles.
- If an apple hits the core, your score increases.
- If an apple hits an active shield, it is repelled and you gain nothing.

Your goal with apples: **do not block them, let them reach the core**.

## Difficulty Phases

### Learning Phase

- Bombs are rare and apples are frequent.
- Projectile speed is low.
- Aim:
    - Get used to the controls.
    - Practice activating the correct shield segment.
    - Learn to trust that letting apples hit the core is good.

### Disruption Phase

- Bombs become more common over time.
- Projectile speed increases.
- Spawn patterns begin to change.
- Aim:
    - Adjust from passive behaviour (letting everything through) to active defence.
    - Start making quick decisions about which projectile to prioritise.

### Flow Phase

- Projectiles become very fast.
- Spawn intervals become very short.
- The game expects almost pure reflex play.
- Aim:
    - Let your reactions take over.
    - Avoid overthinking each input; rely on rhythm and instinct.

## Spawn Patterns

### Stream

- Many projectiles arrive from one direction in a row.
- Strategy:
    - Hold the shield in that direction for the duration.
    - Watch for apples mixed in and briefly release if you can afford it.

### Pincer

- Projectiles arrive from opposite directions at the same time.
- Strategy:
    - Quickly decide which side is more dangerous.
    - Often you will block the side with bombs and sacrifice apples on the other.

### Chaos

- Projectiles spawn from many directions unpredictably.
- Strategy:
    - Stay calm and scan the whole screen.
    - Move your shield only when necessary.
    - Avoid panicking and flicking between directions too fast.

## Summary

- Use directional inputs to raise and lower shields around the octagon.
- Block red bombs to stay alive.
- Let green apples hit the core to earn points.
- Adapt to increasing speed and more complex spawn patterns.
- Practice until your decisions move from conscious thought to instinctive reaction.
